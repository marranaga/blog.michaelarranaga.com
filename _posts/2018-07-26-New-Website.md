I have a new website! That's not original. Tons of people create websites every day, so what makes this one special?

I'm both a student and employee at the University of North Texas. I work for the University in the Computing for Arts + Sciences department as a Service Desk Supervisor. At the same time, I'm finishing up my B.S. in Computer Science. Only 8 more classes and I'm free!

Most of my day to day job is to work with our Desktop manager to maintain our Windows desktop deployments, create and manage application deployment wrappers. Most of this is done using PowerShell, Software Center Configuration Manager (SCCM or ConfigMgr), Jenkins, and Group Policy.

I am by no means a professional at any of this, so this will be a great way for me to document my methodology, as well as be a great reference for the future!
