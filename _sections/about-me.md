## Student

At the same time, I'm completing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. A majority of my programming courses focus in C and C++. I'd have to say that the most interesting project we've worked on was to create a pseudo proxy server in C that fetched a websites HTML content using HTTP GET, stored the content in a local cache, and maintained a blacklist file. This project was incredibly difficult, but ultimately was a pretty fun challenge.
